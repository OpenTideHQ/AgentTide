# AGENTS.md — Unified agent entrypoint (OpenTide / AgentTide)

Canonical instructions for autonomous coding assistants working across **AgentTide** (this harness repository) and **OpenTide content** repositories. Pair with granular skills under **`skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`** following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) — each `SKILL.md` carries YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) for discovery, with optional `references/`, `assets/`, and `scripts/` subdirectories.

## Repository roles

| Context | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| **AgentTide (`OpenTideHQ/AgentTide`)** | Maintain **AGENTS.md** and reusable skills. Treat substantive harness alterations like product code — **merge via reviewed pull requests** unless admins explicitly bootstrap or hotfix **`main`**.|
| **Content repositories (`ShareTide`, tenants, clones)** | Produce **validated YAML objects**, respect CI, never mutate undelegated scaffolding (schemas/engine paths).|

When unclear which corpus you are editing — ask **before creating paths**.

---

## Prime directives

- **Correctness** — Be exact and cognitively correct when breaking down intelligence and complex threat data into modelled OpenTide artefacts. Treat intelligence fidelity and analytic literalness seriously.
- **Consistency** — Maintain a coherent repository. Sometimes it is better to improve several existing objects before creating a new one. Prefer adjusting related artefacts coherently over isolated one-offs.
- **Transparency** — All changes, decisions, and proposals must be rationalised, discoverable, and surfaced in summaries or commit messages that reviewers can consume.
- **Critical thinking** — No vague conclusions. All modelling decisions must be critical. Challenge weak analytic leaps — politely. You are allowed to disagree with the user when reasoning is poor.
- **Autonomy when safe** — Drive tasks end-to-end when scope permits. As much as possible, aim at performing complete changes autonomously.

## Guardrails

### Content integrity
- **NEVER** tamper with schemas or templates unless explicitly instructed.
- **DO NOT** change configuration files except when explicitly directed.
- **NEVER** create new folders or restructure the repository without explicit request.
- **ALWAYS** validate files against JSON schemas before saving.
- **ALWAYS** use templates as a guide for object structure.

### Top-down enforcement
- Given threat intelligence → create threat object(s) (TVM).
- Given threat objects → create detection objective(s) (DOM).
- Given objective(s) → create detection rule(s) (MDR).
- Per run, avoid mixing object types. Always generate the correct object type, and if prompted to mix, ask whether doing it in a separate PR (after the first objects are merged) is preferable. **Mixing object types is not the intended workflow.**

### Intelligence sourcing
- **DO** use provided intelligence and repository content as your primary source.
- **DO NOT** rely on pre-training data for threat intelligence or TTPs.
- **DO** search and reference existing objects when relevant.
- **DO NOT** hallucinate or invent threat intelligence.
- When there is not enough data from the intelligence presented, you may propose alternatives but **STOP** before proceeding — wait for user acceptance.

## OpenTide framework essentials

OpenTide structures the Detection Engineering lifecycle as as-code (YAML) objects managed in a git repository. There are three core object types:

| Type | Schema tag | Location | Responsibility |
|------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Threat Vector (TVM)** | `tvm::…` | `Objects/Threat Vectors/*.yaml` | Atomically defined TTPs at a low level, directly generated from threat intelligence. Supports bi-directional chaining to represent attack paths. |
| **Detection Objective (DOM)** | `dom::…` | `Objects/Detection Objectives/*.yaml` | Detection capabilities for identified threats. Supports 1:N and N:1 relations with TVMs. Composed of signals (atomic detection rule ideas) that can be referenced by MDRs. |
| **Detection Rule (MDR)** | `mdr::…` | `Objects/Detection Rules/*.yaml` | Detection-as-Code files for deployment. Directly linked to DOMs, indirectly to TVMs. **`configurations.*` blocks keyed by detector platform.** |

Always ingest **living templates** bundled with whichever repository syncs schemas — identifiers evolve.

Detection capability surfaces enumerated by CoreTide-aligned deployments routinely include **`sentinel`**, **`defender_for_endpoint`**, **`splunk`**, **`crowdstrike`**, **`carbon_black_cloud`**, **`sentinel_one`** — consult active meta-schema release notes whenever expanding beyond this catalogue.

---

## Default workflow

1. **TVM intake & modelling** — analyse intelligence, identify distinct TTPs, map relationships
2. **DOM signalisation** — define which signals realise coverage, establish data contracts
3. **MDR platform binding(s)** — deploy detection payloads per connected stack

Avoid mixing heterogeneous object edits in one merge unless explicitly orchestrated — the review surface stays sharper per object type otherwise.

### When creating objects from intelligence

1. **Analyse the intelligence** — review thoroughly, identify distinct TTPs and detection opportunities, map relationships. Avoid inferring from intuition knowledge not present in the source. **STOP** and ask for precision if unsure which object types to create.
2. **Plan the object hierarchy** — determine which TVMs need creating (and chaining opportunities), identify corresponding DOMs, plan MDRs if applicable.
3. **Check for existing content** — search the repository for related objects. Determine if updates to existing files are more appropriate than creating new ones. If updating, preserve coherency, existing UUIDs, and relations.
4. **Consult templates and schemas** — load the appropriate template from `Schemas/Templates/*.yaml`, reference the relevant JSON Schema for field requirements, understand required vs. optional fields.
5. **Generate UUIDs** — use system tools (`uuidgen` on Unix/macOS, `[guid]::NewGuid()` on PowerShell). **NEVER reuse UUIDs from existing objects.** If unable to generate, clearly instruct the user to add them manually.
6. **Create objects** — start with TVMs (foundational), then DOMs (link to TVMs), finally MDRs (link to DOMs). Place files in the correct folders per project structure.
7. **Validate** — check for schema validation errors, verify all required fields are populated, confirm UUIDs are unique, review relationships between objects.

## Query & platform skill routing

Microsoft stacks share **KQL** idioms (**`kusto-query-language`**), diverging operationally (**`microsoft-sentinel`** vs **`microsoft-defender-endpoint`**). Splunk adopts **SPL** (**`splunk-spl-processing`**). Endpoint / XDR SaaS integrations each carry authored guardrails (**`crowdstrike-falcon`**, **`sentinelone-singularity`**, **`carbon-black-cloud`**, **`harfanglab`**). Operational maturity spanning hunts → alerts leverages **`detection-engineering`** regardless of vendor.

Never invent vendor syntax — defer to sanctioned references or mirrored samples.

## Critical constraints

### Schema compliance
- ✅ Always validate against JSON schemas.
- ✅ Use templates to understand structure before consulting full schemas.
- ✅ Search schemas for specific field requirements (schemas may be too large to load entirely).
- ❌ Never generate objects without understanding the schema requirements.

### UUID management
- ✅ Generate unique UUIDs using system tools.
- ✅ Clearly indicate when users must add UUIDs manually.
- ❌ Never reuse existing UUIDs.
- ❌ Never fabricate or hardcode UUIDs.

### File management
- ✅ Respect the existing folder structure.
- ✅ Place files in the correct `Objects/` subdirectory.
- ❌ Do not create new folders without explicit user request.
- ❌ Do not modify configuration or schema files without user approval.

### Authoring
- ✅ Use British English by default consistently.
- ✅ Focus on one object type per run unless the user explicitly requests a more complex operation.
- ❌ Do not create extremely long `terrain` sections in TVMs — keep them coherent, well documented, and relatively concise.
- ❌ Do not overassume when generating detection rule queries. If confidence is low, generate the object without the query and propose pseudocode as a comment, mentioning your reasoning to the user.

## Content repository guardrails

Unless explicitly commissioned:

- **Do not hand-edit schema templates/meta-registries blindly.**
- **Do not restructure authoritative folder layouts.**
- **Generate fresh UUID** values for genuinely new artefacts — reuse only when logically identical lineage persists.
- Prefer **British English** unless policy overrides downstream.

## Communication protocol

### When starting a task
1. Acknowledge the task.
2. Outline your understanding and approach.
3. Ask clarifying questions if needed.
4. Create a plan and to-dos.

### During task execution
1. Explain what you are doing at each major step.
2. Highlight any decisions or assumptions made.

### When completing a task
1. Summarise what was created or modified.
2. Explain the relationships between objects.
3. Provide any necessary next steps or manual actions required.
4. Confirm all files are in the correct locations.
5. If you focused on one object type and already identified opportunities for additional object type creation, propose a follow-up operation explicitly.
